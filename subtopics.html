      <h1 class='information-titles'>electroencephalography</h1>
      <div class='information-block1'>
        An EEG is an electroencephalogram, a device that measures electrical activity within the brain. Electroencephalography is the science of using EEGs to study brains, specifically in medical settings. Electrodes are attached to the patient’s scalp, and the measured electrical output is displayed as wavy lines. Brain cells have electrical impulses all the time, and studying their waves allows doctors to diagnose conditions like epilepsy (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 2022), and look for problems such as dementia, brain tumors, and sleep disorders. EEG procedures last about 20-40 minutes, and are usually safe and painless (National Health Service, 2022).

      <h1 class='information-titles'>speech recognition</h1>
      <div class='information-block1'>
        Also known as Automatic Speech Recognition or ASR, speech recognition is what allows computers to recognize human speech and translate it into text. Often confused for voice recognition, speech recognition deals with changing spoken words to text, whereas voice recognition often employs speech recognition but also differentiates between different people’s voices (IBM Cloud Education, 2020).

      <h1 class='information-titles'>brain-computer interaction</h1>
      <div class='information-block1'>
        Brain computer interaction refers to the direct connection between the brain and other computers or devices (Saha et al., 2021, 1). It allows for communication between the central nervous system and the computer, without assistance from the peripheral system (hands, speech, etc). Early BCI provided a way for people who are physically disabled to interact and communicate with their environment (Gao et al., 2021), and it was originally seen as a way to change or replace neural rehabilitation (Saha et al., 2021, 1).
