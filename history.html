        Human computer interaction first came into fruition in the early 1980s, since not many people had access to computers before that. At first, it was a specialized area within computer science, with parts of cognitive science and human factor engineering as well. After the 1980s, personal computers were used by many people, which also increased the number of defects discovered in computers. Human computer interaction was then recognized as something that was needed to make programs easier to use, and was dubbed “one of the first examples of cognitive engineering” (Carroll, 2014).

          <p>The EEG was first used on a 17 year old boy by a German psychiatrist. It was an important milestone for neuroscience and neurosurgical practices, and was incredibly useful for those with seizures (Tudor et al., n.d.).</p>

          <h2>1972</h2>
          <p>Alan Kay joined Xerox, and made it possible for icons to show up on the screens of computers. Such as folders. Making it possible for a virtual desktop (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2022).</p>

        <div class="timeline-container">
          <h2>1980s</h2>
          <p>A crucial time for speech to text technology— statistics were used to determine the probability of words coming from an unknown sound, and the Markov model developed by Andrey Markov, didn’t rely on templates of speech patterns (Paz, n.d.). HCI truly started to emerge into the industry, as a specialty area within computer science with parts of cognitive science and human factor engineering (Carroll, 2014).</p>

        <div class="timeline-container">
          <h2>1983</h2>
          <p>The Human Processor Model was created by Card, Moran, and Newell, they created a connection in the way humans process and store information to how computers process and store data. As this helped designers figure out which interfaces worked for people (Lamas, 2013).</p>

        Currently, research on HCI involves the innovation of user interface tools, the study of using working together, tools for tech support, and gesture interaction. Visual interfaces, along with visualizing data, are always things that are being worked on, along with human-robot interactions and research on the impacts of technology on society. HCI initiatives build, design, and study new tools to support humans and business. One such example is MHCI, who currently have the capstone program. This involves creating wellness routines for employees to engage in. This was caused by Covid-19 and their physiological impacts on people. This shows how HCI aids in improving mental health of workers (Human-Computer Interaction Institute, n.d.).

          EEGs are constantly being used, but especially for studies in the medical field for diagnoses. One study uses EEGs to monitor if vigorous exercise significantly impacts spikes in children with epilepsy, attempting to predict West Syndrome (a seizure disorder in infants) before seizures actually occur (Rochester, n.d.).
EEGs were also employed during the pandemic, and it was seen that there was a severe EEG divergence in 30-40% of COVID-19 patients. New neurological changes can occur in severe cases of COVID-19, and those with existing epilepsy conditions were at high risk for abnormal EEGs and new neurological changes (Skorin et al., 2020).

            Speech recognition technology is constantly being worked on, as it often goes hand in hand with accessibility and entertainment. Currently, voice clones are being created to form more emotional speech for games and movies without the use of a voice actor. Voice-activated mobile payments are also being researched, along with chat-bots that allow for a more natural user experience. Generally, speech recognition is being used to make things more convenient for users, whether in video games, in home settings, or online (IndustryTrends, 2022).

          Brain computer interaction is currently being worked on so that its products are expanded to target the general population, by incorporating the technology into things like AR/VR (Microsoft's Brain-Computer Interfaces Project, n.d.). By expanding the audience and consumer pool, BCI can be made more accessible and increase the convenience of people’s everyday lives.
