          Human computer interaction is a field that studies how the users (i.e us as humans), interact with computers. Interfaces are designed based on the user's wants and needs, enhancing the experience and often making jobs easier (Kanade, 2022). Jobs can be done in a more specific and efficient way, sometimes making it more enjoyable (Kaur, 2022, 1). The four concepts of HCI are the user, goal-oriented tasks—or the goal for the program—the interface, and the context, which is the type of program and what it's used for (Kanade, 2022).

              Human computer interaction is also linked to fields such as interaction design. Interaction design is a part of user experience design, and allows users to accomplish their goals in the best way possible. In essence, it is the design of the interaction between the user and the program (Mishra, 2021).

        <h2>Apple</h2>
        <div class='big-player-text'>
          Apple, who virtually everyone knows of, sets itself apart with its incredibly exclusive system— with their own operating system, hardware, and services, it prevents third parties from interfering, making for an extremely cohesive ecosystem, but also an expensive and rigid one (Bajarin, 2012). Apple’s contribution to society is an obvious one, but their Apple Watch is a prime example of HCI. Although it wasn’t the first ever smartwatch, it is certainly the one that changed the industry and popularized tech as a fashion accessory. It interacts with the user in various ways, even when sleeping, working out, and just walking. Despite its size, it provides endless ways for users to access and record information, and it also employs speech recognition as a way to control it.

        <div class='big-player-text'>
          Alphabet Inc, better known as Google’s parent company, publicized the fact that HCI is a research area, with specialized researchers to improve the interactive experience for users. Their work has impacted over billions of users, as they try to understand user behaviour and work on things like predicting user actions, recommending content, and more. They also invent and build interactive systems from scratch, heavily utilizing machine learning alongside HCI (Google's HCI Research, n.d.).

          Microsoft has also publicly announced their work on HCI research, with designers, engineers, and researchers working on user-centered approaches to improving their products. Some of their specialty areas include interactive techniques and devices, augmented and virtual reality, wearable tech, and inclusive/accessible technology design. One project they are working on, called Caption Crawler, works to help those who are visually impaired by providing descriptions to images that screen readers can read (Microsoft Research’s Human-Computer Interaction Group (HCI@MSR), n.d.).

          In electroencephalography, Natus Medical Inc is one of the most prominent companies that offers medical products and equipment, including EEGs. They have been a brand for over 80 years, with many products used to enhance and advance patient treatment and quality of life (Natus Medical Incorporated, n.d.). They focus on devices for the nervous system, and are widely recognized within the healthcare sector.

        <div class='big-player-text'>
          For brain-computer interaction, Neuralink (founded by Elon Musk) works to access areas of the brain and gather neural information. This helps to change how users experience the world around them, along with how they interact with others. Neuralink also creates devices for those with disabilities such as paralysis, hearing loss, and blindness, working to help them regain independence (Neuralink, n.d.). The work Neuralink does has the potential to solve neurological disorders, or at the very least, allow those who are affected to live a more comfortable life.

        <div class='big-player-text'>
          Speech recognition is apparent everywhere, including through Google’s voice assistant, Siri, Alexa, and more. The company Tencent also does research specifically in this area, with an emphasis on making HCI as seamless as real life human-to-human interactions. Applications of research in this area would include virtual service workers, assistants, and even pets. (Tencent AI Lab, n.d.). Tencent also produces various games which use speech recognition as a gameplay feature to allow players to communicate with each other by changing speech to text that can be read by your teammates, rather than needing to type in the chat. Additionally, the app WeChat allows for users to communicate with each other with the option for speech-to-text.

      <h2>Ben Shneiderman</h2>
      Ben Shneiderman is known as the founding father of HCI, as he was the founding director of the Human Computer Interaction Lab at University of Maryland, from 1983 to 2000, where he discovered and studied many things. Such as genomic data analysis. Along with being a professor of computer science there as well, and has published many books about HCI and AI. Most recently in 2022 he published a book called “Human-Centered AI”, displaying the great findings, opportunities and the future of this topic. He recently received the HCI Medal for Societal Impact in January of 2022 for his contributions to HCI.

      <h2>Alan Kay</h2>
      Alan Kay, born in 1940, was a computer scientist who planned to make the Dynabook, a tablet sized computer. His project never came into being, but as you can see today, we do have portable computers. In 1972, he joined the Xerox corporation, and worked in PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), a computer company focused on computer engineering and information technology. The work he did here ended up being the basis for the graphical interface used by Microsoft Windows 95. In 1983, he left Xerox to work for Apple, for which his GUI design was used for Mac OS (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2022).

    <div class='curriculum-content' style="width: 85%;">
      HCI deals with both hardware and software, because of the way it works to develop interactions between humans and computers. In history, practicality and usability has been an afterthought when developing new programming languages or software, which then makes programming a skill that requires quite a bit of time and practice to pick up. HCI’s principles and approaches place an emphasis on user convenience and ease, keeping it simple and consistent (Pane et al., 2002, 2). 
    </div>
    <div class='curriculum-content' style="width: 80%;">
      Speech recognition itself is also a subfield of computer science, and can be described as working with a library of words that are compared to the inputs, or what the device hears. It’s like a long arraylist, with the computer comparing each element with the input to find the corresponding word. Programming is also required to output words into text, and recognize pauses for punctuation. Additionally, it needs to be able to differentiate between homophones based on context (IBM Cloud Education, 2020).
    </div>
    <div class='curriculum-content' style="width: 75%;">
      Electroencephalography (EEG) can be connected to what we know already, because well, it requires programming, which we have learned the basics of. The data received from an EEG can be analyzed by people, but for efficiency, a program can be created to do the analyses over and over (Albajes-Eizagirre, 2014).
    </div>
    <div class='curriculum-content' style="width: 70%;">
     Brain computer interaction (BCI) also requires programming, in order to gather and sort the data received from the user. As brain signals are gathered, they need to be formatted in a way that makes sense to the user. Tables are made, patterns are spotted, and so on.
    </div>
    <div class='curriculum-content' style="width: 65%;">
     For both EEG and BCI, machine learning plays a role. When data is collected, the computer has to predict, correct and store the information as something that is legible by humans. When this data is stored in a database, the computer utilises the decision tree algorithm (Tavasoli, 2023), a type of divide and conquer. Through recursion, the computer is able to split up data and narrow down what is the most optimal location to store the information (Divide and Conquer, n.d.).
